        <h2>Our process</h2>
        <p>
          Each cameo begins with a high resolution scan of your photograph.
          We adjust contrast, color, and sharpness to work well on porcelain,
          then print the image on specialized ceramic media and fire it onto
          the enamel surface in a kiln.
        </p>

        <h2>Who we work with</h2>
        <p>
          We supply both monument shops and individual families. If you already
          have a headstone company, we are happy to coordinate with them on
          sizing and mounting.
